# Wordler

## Description

This project is a web application, intended for memorising words to assist in learning new languages.
The words are chosen by the user itself and are organised into separate lists. The user can then play
games for memorising words, chosing the list of words to practice before each game.

The project was created by Alexander Fedchin in 2024 using React for frontend and NodeJS for backend.

## How to run locally (non-dockerized version)

To run the application locally, `git clone` the directory, `cd wordler` then run the `cd frontend/`,
`npm install` and `npm start` to run the frontend. Then, in a different terminal window
simultaniously, run `cd backend/` from the root directory of the project, `npm install` and
`node server.js`. After that the frontend will be running on http://localhost:3000/ and backend
will be running on http://localhost:8000/ at the same time and the application is ready for use.
